## Contents
- Introduction to k-means, k-means++ and DBSCAN.
- Analyze several drawbacks of k-means and introduce different kind of techniques to address them.
- Introduction to how we use supervised and unsupervised methods on measuring cluster quality such as homogeneity, completeness and *Silhouette Coefficient*.
